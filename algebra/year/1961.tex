\item Solve the system of equations:\\
\\ x + y + z = a\\
\\ $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = b^2$\\
\\ $xy = z^2$\\
\\ where a and b are constants. Give the conditions that a and b must satisfy so that x, y, z (the solutions of the system) are distinct positive numbers.\\

\item Solve the equation $cos^n x - sin^n x = 1$, where n is a natural number.
