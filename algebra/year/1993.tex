\item  Let f(x) = $x^n$ + $5x^{n-1}$+3, where $n>1$ is an integer. Prove that f(x)
cannot be expressed as the product of two nonconstant polynomials
with integer coefficients.

\item  There are n lamps $L_0$, ... , $L_{n-1}$ in a circle $(n>1)$, where we denote $L_{n+k}$ = $L_k$. (A lamp at all times is either on or off.) Perform steps $s_0$, $s_1$, ... as follows: at step $s_i$, if $L_{i-1}$ is lit, switch $L_i$
from on to off or
vice versa, otherwise do nothing. Initially all lamps are on. Show that:\\
\\ \begin{enumerate}
\item There is a positive integer M(n) such that after M(n) steps all the lamps are on again;
\item If n = $2^k$, we can take M(n) = $n^2$ - 1;
\item If n = $2^k$ + 1, we can take M(n) = $n^2$-n+1.
\end{enumerate}
