\item Let m and n be positive integers. Let $a_1$, $a_2$, ... ,$a_m$ be distinct elements of {1, 2, ... , n} such that whenever $a_i$ + $a_j$ $\leq n$ for some i, j, $1 \leq i \leq j \leq m$,
there exists k, $1 \leq k \leq m$, with $a_i$ + $a_j$ = $a_k$. Prove that\\
\\ $\frac{a_1+a_2+...+a_m}{m}$ $\geq$ $\frac{n+1}{2}$.\\

\item . Determine all ordered pairs (m, n) of positive integers such that $\frac{n^3+1}{mn-1}$ is an integer.\\

\item Show that there exists a set A of positive integers with the following property: For any infinite set S of primes there exist two positive integers $m \in A$ and $n \notin$ A each of which is a product of k distinct elements of S for some $k\geq 2$.
