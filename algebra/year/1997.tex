\item Let $x_1, x_2, .... , x_n$ be real numbers satisfying the conditions\\
\\ $\begin{vmatrix} x_1 + x_2 + .... + x_n \end{vmatrix} = 1$\\
\\ and\\
$\begin{vmatrix}x_i \end{vmatrix} \leq \frac{n+1}{2}$  i = 1, 2, . . . , n\\
\\ Show that there exists a permutation $y_1, y_2, . . . , y_n$ of $x_1, x_2, . . . , x_n$ such that\\
\\ $\begin{vmatrix}y_1+2y_2+...+ny_n \end{vmatrix} \leq \frac{n+1}{2}$\\

\item Find all pairs (a, b) of integers a, $b \geq 1$ that satisfy the equation\\
\\ $a^{b^{2}} = b^a$.\\

\item For each positive integer n , let f(n) denote the number of ways of representing n as a sum of powers of 2 with non-negative integer exponents. Representations which differ only in the ordering of their summands are considered to be the same. For instance, f(4) = 4, because the number 4 can be represented in the
following four ways:\\
\\ 4; 2 + 2; 2 + 1 + 1; 1 + 1 + 1 + 1.\\
\\ Prove that, for any integer $n \geq 3$,\\
\\ $2^\frac{n^2}{4} < f(2^n) < 2^\frac{n^2}{2}$
