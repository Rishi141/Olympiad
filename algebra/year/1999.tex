\item Consider an n x n square board, where n is a fixed even positive integer. The board is divided into $n^2$ unit squares. We say that two different squares on the board are adjacent if they have a common side.\\
\\ N unit squares on the board are marked in such a way that every square (marked or unmarked) on the board is adjacent to at least one marked square.\\
\\ Determine the smallest possible value of N.\\

\item Determine all pairs (n, p) of positive integers such that\\
\\ p is a prime,\\
\\ n not exceeded 2p, and\\
\\ $(p - 1)^n$ + 1 is divisible by $n^{p-1}$.
