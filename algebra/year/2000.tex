\item A, B, C are positive reals with product 1. Prove that $(A - 1 +\frac{1}{B})(B - 1 + \frac{1}{C})(C - 1 + \frac{1}{A}) \leq 1$.\\

\item k is a positive real. N is an integer greater than 1. N points are placed on a line, not all coincident. A move is carried out as follows. Pick any two points A and B which are not coincident. Suppose that A lies to the right of B. Replace B by another point B0 to the right of A such that $AB^{'} = kBA$. For what values of k can we move the points arbitrarily far to the right by repeated moves?
