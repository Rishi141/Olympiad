\item S is the set of all (h, k) with h, k non-negative integers such that h + $k < n$. Each element of S is colored red or blue, so that if (h, k) is red and $h^{'}\leq h, k^{'} \leq k$, then ($h^{'}, k^{'}$) is also red. A type 1 subset of S has n blue elements with different first member and a type 2 subset of S has n blue elements with different second member. Show that there are the same number of type 1 and type 2 subsets.\\

\item Find all pairs of integers $m > 2$, $n > 2$ such that there are infinitely many positive integers k for which $k^n + k^2 - 1$ divides $k^m + k + 1$.\\

\item The positive divisors of the integer $n > 1$ are $d_1 < d_2 < ... < d_k$, so that $d_1 = 1$, $d_k = n$. Let $d = d_1d_2 + d_2d_3 + ... + d_{k-1}d_k$. Show that $d < n^2$ and find all n for which d divides $n^2$.
