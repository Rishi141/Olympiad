\item Find all polynomials f with real coefficients such that for all reals a,b,c such that ab + bc + ca = 0 we have the following relations\\
\\ f(a - b)+f(b - c)+f(c - a) = 2f(a+b+c).\\

\item Let $n \geq 3$ be an integer. Let $t_1, t_2, ..., t_n$ be positive real numbers such that\\
\\ $n^2+1 > (t_1 + t_2 +....+t_n) (\frac{1}{t_1} + \frac{1}{t_2}
+....+ \frac{1}{t_n})$.\\
\\ Show that $t_i, t_j, t_k$ are side lengths of a triangle for all i, j, k with
$1 \leq i < j < k \leq n$.
