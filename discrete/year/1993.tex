\item On an infinite chessboard, a game is played as follows. At the start, $n^2$ pieces are arranged on the chessboard in an n by n block of adjoining squares, one piece in each square. A move in the game is a jump in a horizontal or vertical direction over an adjacent occupied square to an unoccupied square immediately beyond. The piece which has been jumped over is removed. Find those values of n for which the game can end with only one piece remaining on the board.

\item Does there exist a function f : $N \rightarrow N$ such that f(1) = 2, f(f(n)) = f(n) + n for all $n \in N$, and $f(n) < f(n + 1)$ for all $n \in N$?
