\item For any positive integer k, let f(k) be the number of elements in the set {k+1, k+2, ... , 2k} whose base 2 representation has precisely three 1s.\\
\\ \begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that, for each positive integer m, there exists at least one positive integer k such that f(k) = m.
\item Determine all positive integers m for which there exists exactly one k with f(k) = m.
\end{enumerate}

\item Let S be the set of real numbers strictly greater than -1. Find all functions f : $S \rightarrow S$ satisfying the two conditions:\\
\\ \begin{enumerate}
\item f(x+f(y)+xf(y)) = y+f(x)+yf(x) for all x and y in S;
\item $\frac{f(x)}{x}$ is strictly increasing on each of the intervals $-1<x<0$ and $0<x$
\end{enumerate}
