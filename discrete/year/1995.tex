\item Determine all integers $n > 3$ for which there exist n points $A_1, ... , A_n$
in the plane, no three collinear, and real numbers $r_1, ... , r_n$ such that
for $1 \leq i < j < k \leq n$, the area of $\triangle A_iA_jA_k$ is $r_i + r_j + r_k$.\\

\item Let p be an odd prime number. How many p-element subsets A of
{1, 2, . . . 2p} are there, the sum of whose elements is divisible by p?
