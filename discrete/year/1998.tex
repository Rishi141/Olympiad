\item In a competition, there are a contestants and b judges, where $b \geq 3$ is an odd integer. Each judge rates each contestant as either “pass” or “fail”. Suppose k is a number such that, for any two judges, their ratings coincide for at most k
contestants. Prove that k/a $\geq$ (b - 1)/(2b).

\item Consider all functions f from the set N of all positive integers into itself satisfying $f(t^2f(s)) = s(f(t))^2$ for all s and t in N. Determine the least possible value of f(1998).
