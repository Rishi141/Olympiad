\item Determine all finite sets S of at least three points in the plane which satisfy the following condition:
for any two distinct points A and B in S, the perpendicular bisector of the line segment AB is an axis of symmetry for S.\\

\item Let n be a fixed integer, with $n \geq 2$.\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine the least constant C such that the inequality\\
\\ $\sum_{1\leq i < j\leq n} x_ix_j(x_i^2 + x_j^2) \leq C(\sum_{1 \leq i \leq n}x_i)^4$\\
\\ holds for all real numbers $x_1, ... , x_n \geq 0$\\
\item For this constant C, determine when equality holds.
\end{enumerate}

\item Determine all functions f : $R \rightarrow R$ such that\\
\\ f(x - f(y)) = f(f(y)) + xf(y) + f(x) - 1 for all real numbers x, y.
