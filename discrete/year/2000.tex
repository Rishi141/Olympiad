\item 100 cards are numbered 1 to 100 (each card different) and placed in 3 boxes (at least one card in each box). How many ways can this be done so that if two boxes are selected and a card is taken from each, then the knowledge of their sum alone is always sufficient to identify the third box?\\

\item Can we find N divisible by just 2000 different primes, so that N divides $2^{N} + 1$? [N may be divisible by a prime power.]
