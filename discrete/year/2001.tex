\item Twenty-one girls and twenty-one boys took part in a mathematical contest.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Each contestant solved at most six problems.
 \item For each girl and each boy, at least one problem was solved by both of them.
\end{enumerate}
 Prove that there was a problem that was solved by at least three girls and at least three boys.\\

\item Let n be an odd integer greater than 1, and let $k_1, k_2,...., k_n$ be given integers. For each of the n! permutations a = $(a_1, a_2, …, a_n)$ of 1 , 2, …, n, let\\
\\ $S(a)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} k_ia_i$.\\
\\ Prove that there are two permutations b and c, $b \neq c$, such that n! is a divisor of S(b)-S(c).
