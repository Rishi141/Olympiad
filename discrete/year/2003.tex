\item S is the set {1, 2, 3, . . . , 1000000}. Show that for any subset A of S with 101 elements we can find 100 distinct elements $x_i$ of S, such that the sets ${a + x_i/a \in A}$ are all pairwise disjoint.\\

\item Given $n > 2$ and reals $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq .... \leq x_n$, show that
$(\sum_{i,j}\begin{vmatrix} x_i - x_j \end{vmatrix})^2 \leq \frac{2}{3}(n^2 -1) \sum_{i,j}(x_i -x_j)^2$. Show that we have equality iff the sequence is an arithmetic progression.
