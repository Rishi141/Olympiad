\item Consider triangle $P_1P_2P_3$ and a point P within the triangle. Lines $P_1P$, $P_2P$, $P_3P$ intersect the opposite sides in points $Q_1$, $Q_2$, $Q_3$ respectively. Prove that, of the numbers\\
\\ $\frac{P_1P}{PQ_1}$,$\frac{P_2P}{PQ_2}$,$\frac{P_3P}{PQ_3}$\\
\\ at least one is $\leq 2$ and at least one is $\geq 2$.\\

\item Construct triangle ABC if AC = b, AB = c and $\angle AMB = \omega $, where M is the midpoint of segment BC and $\omega < 90^o$. Prove that a solution exists if and only if\\
\\ $btan\frac{\omega}{2}\leq c < b$.\\
\\ In what case does the equality hold?\\

\item Consider a plane $\varepsilon$ and three non-collinear points A, B, C on the same side of $\varepsilon$; suppose the plane determined by these three points is not parallel to $\varepsilon$. In plane a take three arbitrary points $A_0, B_0, C_0$. Let L, M, N be the midpoints of segments $AA^{'}$, $BB^{'}$, $CC^{'}$; let G be the centroid of triangle LMN. (We will not consider positions of the points $A^{'}$, $B^{'}$, $C^{'}$ such that the points L, M, N do not form a triangle.) What is the locus of point G as $A^{'}$, $B^{'}$, $C^{'}$ range independently over the plane $\varepsilon$?
