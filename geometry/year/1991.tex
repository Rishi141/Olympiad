\item Given a triangle ABC, let I be the center of its inscribed circle. The internal bisectors of the angles A, B, C meet the opposite sides in $A^{'}, B^{'}, C^{'}$ respectively. Prove that\\
 $\frac{1}{4} < \frac{AI . BI . CI}{AA^{'}. BB^{'} . CC^{'}} \leq \frac{8}{27}.$

\item Let ABC be a triangle and P an interior point of ABC . Show that at least one of the angles $\angle$PAB, $\angle$PBC, $\angle$PCA is less than or equal to $30^{o}.$
