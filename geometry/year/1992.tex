\item Consider nine points in space, no four of which are coplanar. Each pair of points is joined by an edge (that is, a line segment) and each edge is either colored blue or red or left uncolored. Find the smallest value of n such that whenever exactly n edges are colored, the set of colored edges necessarily contains a triangle all of whose edges have the same color.\\ 

\item In the plane let C be a circle, L a line tangent to the circle C, and M a point on L. Find the locus of all points P with the following property: there exists two points Q, R on L such that M is the midpoint of QR and C is the inscribed circle of triangle PQR.
