\item Let A, B, C, D be four distinct points on a line, in that order. The circles with diameters AC and BD intersect at X and Y . The line XY meets BC at Z. Let P be a point on the line XY other than Z. The line CP intersects the circle with diameter AC at C and M, and the line BP intersects the circle with diameter BD at B and N. Prove that the lines AM, DN, XY are concurrent.\\

\item Let ABCDEF be a convex hexagon with AB = BC = CD and DE = EF = F A, such that $\angle BCD = \angle EFA = \frac{\pi}{3}$. Suppose G and H are points in the interior of the hexagon such that $\angle AGB = \angle DHE = \frac{2\pi}{3}$. Prove that AG + GB + GH + DH + $HE \geq CF$.
