\item We are given a positive integer r and a rectangular board ABCD with
dimensions $\begin{vmatrix} AB \end{vmatrix} = 20$, $\begin{vmatrix} BC \end{vmatrix} = 12$. The rectangle is divided into a grid of 20 $\times$ 12 unit squares. The following moves are permitted on the board: one can move from one square to another only if the distance between the centers of the two squares is $\sqrt{r}$. The task is to find a sequence of moves leading from the square with A as a vertex to the square with B as a vertex.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that the task cannot be done if r is divisible by 2 or 3.
\item Prove that the task is possible when r = 73.
\item Can the task be done when r = 97?
\end{enumerate}

\item Let P be a point inside triangle ABC such that\\
\\ $\angle APB - \angle ACB$ = $\angle APC - \angle ABC$.\\
\\ Let D, E be the incenters of triangles APB, APC, respectively. Show that AP, BD, CE meet at a point.\\

\item Let ABCDEF be a convex hexagon such that AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF , and CD is parallel to F A. Let RA, RC, RE denote the circumradii of triangles F AB, BCD, DEF ,respectively, and let P denote the perimeter of the hexagon. Prove that\\
\\ $R_A + R_C + R_E \geq \frac{P}{2}$.
