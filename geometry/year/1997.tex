\item In the plane the points with integer coordinates are the vertices of unit squares. The squares are colored alternately black and white (as on a chessboard).For any pair of positive integers m and n, consider a right-angled triangle whose vertices have integer coordinates and whose legs, of lengths m and n, lie along edges of the squares.\\
Let S1 be the total area of the black part of the triangle and S2 be the total area of the white part. Let\\
\\ f(m, n) = $\begin{vmatrix} S_1 - S_2 \end{vmatrix}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate f(m, n) for all positive integers m and n which are either both even or both odd.
\item Prove that $f(m, n) \leq \frac{1}{2} \max{m, n}$ for all m and n.
\item Show that there is no constant C such that $f(m, n) < C$ for all m and n.
\end{enumerate}

\item The angle at A is the smallest angle of triangle ABC. The points B and C divide the circumcircle of the triangle into two arcs. Let U be an interior point of the arc between B and C which does not contain A. The perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC meet the line AU at V and W , respectively. The lines BV and CW meet at T . Show that\\
\\ AU = TB + TC.
