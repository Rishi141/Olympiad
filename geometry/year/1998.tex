\item In the convex quadrilateral ABCD, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular and the opposite sides AB and DC are not parallel. Suppose that the point P , where the perpendicular bisectors of AB and DC meet, is inside ABCD. Prove that ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral if and only if the triangles ABP and CDP have equal areas.\\


\item Let I be the incenter of triangle ABC. Let the incircle of ABC touch the sides BC, CA, and AB at K, L, and M, respectively. The line through B parallel to MK meets the lines LM and LK at R and S, respectively. Prove that angle RIS is acute.
