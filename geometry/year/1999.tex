\item Two circles $G_1$ and $G_2$ are contained inside the circle G, and are tangent to G at the distinct points M and N, respectively. $G_1$ passes through the center of $G_2$. The line passing through the two points of intersection of $G_1$ and $G_2$ meets G at A and B. The lines MA and MB meet $G_1$ at C and D, respectively.
