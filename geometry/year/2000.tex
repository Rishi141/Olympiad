\item AB is tangent to the circles CAMN and NMBD. M lies between C and D on the line CD, and CD is parallel to AB. The chords NA and CM meet at P; the chords NB and MD meet at Q. The rays CA and DB meet at E. Prove that PE = QE.\\

\item $A_1A_2A_3$ is an acute-angled triangle. The foot of the altitude from $A_i$ is $K_i$ and the incircle touches the side opposite $A_i$ at $L_i$. The line $K_1K_2$ is reflected in the line $L_1L_2$. Similarly, the line $K_2K_3$ is reflected in $L_2L_3$ and $K_3K_1$ is reflected in $L_3L_1$. Show that the three new lines form a triangle with vertices on the incircle.
