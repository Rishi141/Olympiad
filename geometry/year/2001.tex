\item Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle with circumcentre O.Let P on BC be the foot of the altitude from A.\\
Suppose that $\angle BCA \geq  \angle ABC +  30^o$ .\\
Prove that $\angle CAB + \angle COP < 90^o$.\\

\item In a triangle ABC, let AP bisect $\angle BAC$ , with P on BC, and let BQ bisect $\angle ABC$, with Q on CA. It is known that $\angle BAC = 60^o$ and that AB + BP = AQ + QB. What are the possible angles of triangle ABC?
