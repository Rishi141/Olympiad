\item BC is a diameter of a circle center O. A is any point on the circle with $\angle AOC > 60^{o}$. EF is the chord which is the perpendicular bisector of AO. D is the midpoint of the minor arc AB. The line through O parallel to AD meets AC at J. Show that J is the incenter of triangle CEF .\\

\item $n > 2$ circles of radius 1 are drawn in the plane so that no line meets more than two of the circles. Their centers are $O_1, O_2, .... , O_n$. Show that $\sum_{i<j}\frac{1}{O_iO_j}\leq (n-1)\frac{\pi}{4}$.
