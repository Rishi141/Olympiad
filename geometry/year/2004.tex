\item Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle with $AB \neq AC$. The circle with diameter BC intersects the sides AB and AC at M and N respectively. Denote by O the midpoint of the side BC. The bisectors of the angles $\angle BAC$ and $\angle MON$ intersect at R. Prove that the circumcircles of the triangles BMR and CNR have a common point lying on the side BC.\\

\item In a convex quadrilateral ABCD the diagonal BD does not bisect the angles ABC and CDA. The point P lies inside ABCD andsatisfies\\
 \\$\angle PBC = \angle DBA$ and $\angle PDC = \angle BDA$.\\
\\Prove that ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral if and only if AP=CP .
